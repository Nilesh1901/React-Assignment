## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nilesh1901/React-Assignment.git
   cd React-Assignment
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   You need to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

   ### Frontend Setup
   Navigate to the `client` folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   ### Backend Setup
   Similarly, go to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Frontend**  
   Start the React frontend application:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
   This will run the frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. **Run the Backend**  
   In another terminal, start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Build

To create a production build of the frontend, run:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```
This will output optimized files in the `client/build` directory.
